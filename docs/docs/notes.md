## Repository notes
- Covers preprocessing of calcium imaging videos, cell and activity trace extraction (supports the following methods: PCA-ICA, CELLMax, EXTRACT, CNMF, CNMF-E, and ROI), manual and automated sorting of cell extraction outputs, cross-session alignment of cells, and more.
- Supports `PCA-ICA`, `CNMF`, `CNMF-E`, `EXTRACT`, and `ROI` cell extraction methods publicly along with `CELLMax` for Schnitzer Lab collaborators. Additional methods can be integrated upon request.
- Most extensively tested on Windows MATLAB `2018b` and `2019a`. Moderate testing on Windows MATLAB `2015b`, `2017a`, `2017b`, and `2018b` along with OSX (10.10.5) `2017b` and `2018b`. Individual functions and `{{ site.name }}` class should work on other MATLAB versions after `2015b`, but submit an issue if errors occur. Newer MATLAB version preferred.
