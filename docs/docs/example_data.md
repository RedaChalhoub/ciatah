### Example data

The `{{ site.name }}` repository contains several example one-photon calcium imaging movies from miniature microscope experiments in freely moving rodents.

To download example data, run `loadDependencies` module (e.g. `obj.loadDependencies`) and select `Download test one-photon data.` option to download one-photon miniature microscope example datasets to use for testing `{{ site.name }}` preprocessing, cell extraction, and cell classification code. The data will be located in the `data` folder within the repository root directory.

Else run `example_downloadTestData.m` from the MATLAB command line with the working directory set to the `{{ site.name }}` repository.
